                    <p>Issued by Government of Gujarat</p>
                    <p>The Government Event Hackathon in India is an intense competition that challenges teams of IT professionals to create innovative solutions for real-world problems faced by the government and society. I was part of a team that participated in the event, which required us to work continuously for 24 hours to develop a project from scratch. During the event, we had to constantly brainstorm and develop new ideas while also coding and debugging our project. In addition, we had to be prepared for occasional visits from the invigilators who would check our progress and provide feedback on our work. These visits were helpful as the invigilators would also assign the next task that the team needed to complete in order to stay on track. Despite the intense pressure, my team and I were able to successfully develop a functional project that impressed the judges and earned us a certificate. The experience allowed me to showcase my skills in coding, problem-solving, and teamwork, and further solidified my passion for the field of IT.</p>

                    <p>Issued by LJ University</p>
                    <p>Innovation Village was a highly competitive event held at LJ Polytechnic to showcase innovative projects by students. During the event, my team and I presented our website Kitab Trend, which aimed to solve the problem of high textbook prices for students. Our website allowed students to buy and sell their textbooks at affordable prices, share their notes and question papers, and also connect with seniors to get guidance on various topics. We emphasized the unique features of our website, such as the option for seniors to sell their books and the feature to share notes, which received positive feedback from the judges. We also highlighted our thorough data validation and storage process in the backend, as well as the user-friendly frontend design. Our hard work and innovation paid off, as we were awarded a certificate from the Innovation Village event. We were thrilled to see our efforts being recognized and appreciated by the judges, and it motivated us to continue to improve our website and make a positive impact on the student community.</p>
